      On a street there is a man who offers you a bet: He throws a coin and if
      it is tails you get $3. If it is heads you lose $1.

      Should you start playing?  a) yes  b) no
    ExpertAnswer: >
      We present a typical situation with an offer that is too good to be true.
      There seems to be one decision with positive expected value. However the
      correct answer to the questions should be "no" because of one would expect
      the man in the street also be rational and not propose the bet if it had
      negative EV for him.

          a) yes
          The expected value of the bet is positive:

          Since the expected value is positive ($1), it is beneficial to play.

            The student's response shows competence in basic probability theory
            but lacks critical thinking about real-world scenarios and the
            potential for hidden factors or deception.

          You should not play this bet. The answer is b) no.

          Here's why:

          This bet is unfair. Even though you win more money if it lands on
          tails, the probability of winning and losing are equal (assuming a
          fair coin). Losing $1 is guaranteed if it lands on heads, while
          winning $3 is less likely (since you only win on one outcome). In the
          long run, you will likely lose money playing this bet.

            The student reaches the correct conclusion but with flawed
            reasoning. They misunderstand the probabilities and expected value,
            incorrectly stating that winning is less likely. Their intuition
            about not playing is right, but for the wrong reasons. They miss the
            key insight about questioning why such a seemingly favorable bet
            would be offered.
