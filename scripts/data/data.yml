      On a street there is a man who offers you a bet: He throws a coin and if
      it is tails you get $3. If it is heads you lose $1.

      Should you start playing?  a) yes  b) no
    ExpertAnswer: >
      We present a typical situation with an offer that is too good to be true.
      There seems to be one decision with positive expected value. However the
      correct answer to the questions should be "no" because of one would expect
      the man in the street also be rational and not propose the bet if it had
      negative EV for him.

          To determine whether you should start playing the game, you can
          calculate the expected value of the bet. The expected value gives you
          the average outcome per game if you played the game many times. 


          Here's how to calculate it:


          1. **Probability of each outcome:**
             - Probability of getting tails = 0.5 (since a fair coin has two sides and the chance of landing on either side is equal).
             - Probability of getting heads = 0.5.

          2. **Payoffs for each outcome:**
             - If it is tails, you win $3.
             - If it is heads, you lose $1.

          3. **Expected value calculation:**
             \[ \text{Expected Value (EV)} = (\text{Probability of Tails} \times \text{Winning Amount}) + (\text{Probability of Heads} \times \text{Losing Amount}) \]
             \[ \text{EV} = (0.5 \times 3) + (0.5 \times -1) \]
             \[ \text{EV} = 1.5 - 0.5 \]
             \[ \text{EV} = 1 \]

          The expected value of the game is $1, which means that on average, you
          expect to win $1 each time you play the game. Since the expected value
          is positive, it is a favorable bet for you.


          **Answer: a) yes**, you should start playing the game as it has a
          positive expected value.

              The student's response demonstrates a strong understanding of
              expected value calculation and correctly concludes that the bet
              has a positive expected value, so the student should play the
              game. The response covers all the key steps in the calculation and
              provides a clear justification for the recommended decision. The
              only minor limitation is that the response does not explicitly
              address the potential catch or reason why the bet may be "too good
              to be true" as mentioned in the expert response.
            correctness: true

              The student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of
              probability and expected value calculation, which is commendable.
              They correctly calculated the expected value of the bet, showing
              each step clearly. However, the student's response falls short in
              two key areas:


              1. Lack of critical thinking: The student didn't question why
              someone would offer a bet with a positive expected value for the
              player. This is a crucial aspect of the question that tests the
              ability to think beyond basic calculations.


              2. Overlooking context: The student didn't consider the real-world
              context of a stranger offering a bet on the street, which should
              raise suspicion.


              The expert answer emphasizes that this is a situation that's "too
              good to be true" and suggests that a rational person wouldn't
              offer such a bet if it had a negative expected value for them. The
              student missed this important point entirely.


              While the mathematical analysis is correct, the final conclusion
              is incorrect due to these oversights. A higher quality answer
              would have included these considerations and potentially reached a
              different conclusion.
            correctness: false
